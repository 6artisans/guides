# Code review checklist

1) Can you run the code?

Don’t skip that. Automated tests look good on paper (ehhhm, computer screen?), but running the project is still a good idea. Automated tests reduce manual testing to the minimum, but don’t exclude it completely.

2) Can you follow through several test scenarios?
Pick obvious and non-obvious ones: do they succeed?

Is the rest of the system looking/working fine? Links to How does it affect the rest of the system? from Code section. Similar, but more straight-forward. Have a click-around and make sure things are fine.

It is strongly recommended to use this [template](../template/README.md).
