# Toggl

When working on a project we aim to be honest. We use following rules for tracking time spent.

Track the time we are actually working, meaning we don't bill 9 to 5. What it means?

- we don't track lunch breaks
- we try to relate our time spent to Trello tasks or other specific actions(meeting with client, discussing quote)
- we do track coffee/tea breaks, while working on something we still think about the problem even in kitchen or bathroom
