# Toggl

Be honest to your colleagues and clients. Please, do not treat your work as a 9 to 5 job and do not track all the personal activities that people usually do in their jobs. You have as much time for your personal things as you want, just don't expect a reward for it.

On the other side, if you don't let your mind rest, your productivity will go down. Such rest is a part of the work and we agreed on resting for 5 minutes every half an hour. If you find yourself in a flow and you forget to rest for 90 minutes, go have a coffee for 15 minutes and track it.

## Do not track

- lunch breaks
- personal emails, phonecalls, chats
- learning new things, unless related to a specific task
- coffee/tea breaks unless listed below
- company development, team management


## Do track

- programming, analysis, reading/writing documentation
- team communication over a specific task
- all clients communication, including preparing a new project
- 5 minutes of rest every half an hour (working on a side project is not resting)

## How to track

Try to relate your time spent to Trello tasks or other specific actions (meeting with client, discussing quote).

Activities such as code review or testing are part of a specific task, track them as such, please.
