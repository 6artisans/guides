# Problems with metrics over developer progress

It’s easy for clients to assume that when you deliver 30 story points in one week, you’ll always deliver 30 story points.

Without story points you are required to break tasks down until they’re all roughly the same size.

I’ve typically found story points don’t hold the same meaning over time.

Josef: I find this to be very important note. He basically says that you need to be able to tell estimates to client immediately, so its reasonable to break down tasks right in front of client.
