# Project management guidelines

For projects lasting more than a quarter.

Two week cycles
 - monday, first week
     - make sure they can show the result to someone

- friday, second week
     - demonstrate
     - adjust priorities

Trello
- features, bugs, technical points like refactoring testing and technical debt

- agree on the **tasks** to be done in a two-week cycle with the client at each Monday meeting

- make tasks really really really small
     - ideally no more than one person day of work

Underplan
All software projects slip. All of them. Always. Forever.
At worst, this means that we don’t have a particularly excellent week, but still ship something.
At best, it means that we’re able to spend extra time **fixing bugs** and doing **refactoring** without having to **delay** feature releases to the client.

Pull requests
a remarkable ability to get other people to read, validate and test your code before it hits your “master” branch
