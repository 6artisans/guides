# Evaluating clients

## We don't do rewrites.

#### Are we able to maintain the project after it's finished

We want to do that for limited time only. Amount of maintained projects is limited. Exception might be creating own product.

#### Is the client willing to take over the project maintenance/development

We're looking for clients willing to incorporate inhouse team. We want to talk with bussiness people.

#### Does the client understand iterative development

#### Does the client accepts user testing
