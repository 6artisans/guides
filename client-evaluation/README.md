# Evaluating clients

## 100% client satisfaction

Maximum client satisfaction on project delivery should be our mail goal. As such, we should learn about the business circumstances of the client and anticipate any possible miscommunications or errors in the assignment. Instead of making something the client wants at the start, we should aim for something he needs in the end.

Situations to be careful about as they might be a red light:

* **Rewrites** rarely lead to a happy client, as continuous development of existing solutions is usually the better way
* **Many specific requirements about UI without proper user testing process** indicate flawed practice and should probably lead to a product workshop before even any development starts
* **Critical importance of maintenance** is a sign that the project is very important for the client, but the client should know that it is effective to delegate repetitive and mundane tasks to hired employees or cheaper providers. Our team cannot internally handle expanding maintenance models, so creating automation and using services should be always part of the project.

## Managing risk of the client

Any software project is a risk and there is a chance that the project doesn't end up to the client satisfaction. There are two possible ways how to acceptably process such situation:

1. Return money to the client - Make sure that the risk is included in the price and that we **can leave the project at any time** without additional costs for the client.
2. Continue working on the project until the client is happy - Make sure there are **no rigorous deadlines** which might prevent that.

To manage the risk on our side, there is a **maximum size of a project** that we are able to accept, which is currently 3-6 man-months or work.

## Work granularity

The delivery of a project should always be a moment when something of a value for customer was created. The customer should always feel that he got something important for his money that he can use in the future, whether it is software application, documentation, market (in)validation or research outcome.

The size of the project should be as small as possible as long as we delivery the value explained above. There are more ways how to reduce the size of the project:

* **Product MVP** - Redesign the product to include only the most essential parts that the customer's will use. The requirement here is to be able to influence the product design and that should happen well before the development starts.
* **Software Architecture** - Divide the whole project into well-defined technological parts that each has its own responsibility. The requirement here is that the client has to be part of this and must understand how creating one part of the architecture moved him closer to his goals.
